# Ansible Automation: Successful Onboarding
This repository is a collection of thoughts intended to help customers with a successful Ansible Automation adoption. This repository is by no means a substitution for enterprises that are in need of a full blown consulting/services need. The focus is on SMEs that are looking for guidance to accelerate their Ansible automation journey.

# Introduction
I think that the most important thing for a successful automation journey is the planning phase. A well planned automation journey will actually allow you to save time while a badly planned automation journey will likely simply introduce another tool that will eat away precious time in an already busy day. This repository is really meant to help you with the planning and execution of a successful automation journey.

Before you can get started, it is essential to gain a basic understanding of how Ansible works and how playbooks are written. There are a variety of sources available to you:

## Option 1 (recommended): Official Red Hat Workshops
A variety of teams within Red Hat offer [monthly Ansible workshops](https://github.com/ansible/workshops) that you can attend free of charge. These workshop come in 5 different flavors, depending on your background and needs, my recommendation is the basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workshop as it offers a well rounded curriculum:
-  **Ansible Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workshop** focused on automating Linux platforms like Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- **Ansible Network Automation Workshop** focused on router and switch platforms like Arista, Cisco, Juniper
- **Ansible F5 Workshop** focused on automation of F5 BIG-IP
- **Ansible Security Automation** focused on automation of security tools like Check Point Firewall, IBM QRadar and the IDS Snort
- **Ansible Windows Automation Workshop** focused on automation of Microsoft Windows

## Option 2: Online resources, example Udemy
There are dozens of online resources available nowadays. If you prefer to learn at your own pace and you know that this way of learning works well for you - go ahead! I have used Udemy before and can recommend the following course: [Ansible for the Absolute Beginner - Hands-On - DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ansible/) as well as the advanced course [Ansible Advanced - Hands-On DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ansible-advanced/). I have no affiliation with Udemy or the creator.

## Option 3: Self learning (Docs)
If you have experience with other automation tools such as Chef or Puppet and you like to just do your own thing, [skip to the docs and just get your hands dirty](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html). There is no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this, Ansible is straight forward in its application and requires a very minimal setup. The only problem here is that this option generally skips Ansible Tower.

## Option 4: Jeff Geerling (he deserves a mention)
Jeff Geerling runs a [great blog and published dozens of videos on Ansible](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/ansible-101-jeff-geerling-youtube-streaming-series). He also published a book called [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/project/ansible-devops) that has sold >20.000 copies as of 2019. Jeff is a very vocal contributor to the Ansible Open Source project. I can recommend his content as his blogs helped me a lot when starting out.
